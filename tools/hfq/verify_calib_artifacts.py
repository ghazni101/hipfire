"""Verify .calib.hfq artifacts from their own bytes.

The harness prints `coverage N/N [PASS]` and `max_consistency ... [CONSISTENT]`,
and neither is admissible evidence:

  * `max_consistency` compares diag(H) against sum(x^2) where BOTH are
    accumulated from the same staged buffer by two kernels, so it measures
    kernel agreement, not data capture. A tensor that was never collected is
    absent from both sides and the check still reads 0.000e0.
  * A coverage gate compares collected names against the harness's own expected
    set. If the expected set is wrong (as it was when calibration emitted
    runtime names instead of safetensors names), it agrees with itself.

This reads the artifact header directly and reports what is actually inside:
per-tensor token counts, projection-kind histogram, and byte size. A tensor
whose token count differs from the rest was under-collected even if coverage
said PASS.
