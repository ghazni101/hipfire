//! saddle-quant — quantization-quality toolkit.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! The artifact formats (HFQ/HFQM containers, HFHS Hessians, GGUF imatrices,
//! KLD references, score sequences) had no owner. `hipfire-quantize` is
//! primarily a binary; its `lib.rs` exports `hfqm`/`hessian_io`/`hfhs_diag`
//! but not `gguf_input`, and no crate outside it takes the dependency. The
//! result, measured 2026-08-16: **29 files** across `crates/` and `scripts/`
//! independently parse the HFQ header, and the tree has already had to delete
//! redundant parsers by hand (`3dfd1b3f5`, "third redundant HFQ parser").
//!
//! This crate owns each format exactly once.
//!
//! # Methodology defects this crate exists to fix
//!
//! The previous KLD reference pipeline (`build_kld_ref_native` +
//! `eval_hipfire`) produced numbers that could not support the claims made
//! from them. Enumerated so the replacement is written against a spec:
//!
//! 1. **Truncated estimator, unvalidated.** `top_k=256` over a 248,320-token
//!    vocabulary retains 0.103% of the distribution, with residual mass folded
//!    in by approximation. Never validated against full-vocab, and therefore
//!    not comparable to llama.cpp's `--kl-divergence`.
//! 2. **Arbitrary scoring window.** Only positions `[n_ctx/2, n_ctx-1)` were
//!    scored; the first half of every chunk was discarded by construction.
//! 3. **No context depth.** The KV cache was cleared per chunk, so 24
//!    independent 2048-token windows were measured and nothing beyond 2K —
//!    while `kv-mode q8`, the term most likely to degrade with depth, was on.
//! 4. **Unvalidated teacher.** The oracle is hipfire's own forward. A gemma4
//!    teacher scored PPL 1392 on WikiText-2 (a lossless BF16 passthrough of
//!    the upstream parent) and still produced a structurally valid reference.
//!    A broken teacher silently yields a broken reference.
//! 5. **Provenance not stored.** Oracle NLL/PPL were `eprintln`'d at build
//!    time, never written to the header, so `muse-glimmer`'s oracle is
//!    unrecoverable and its KLD cannot be normalized against any other model.
//! 6. **No integrity gate.** Every scoring run logged
//!    `manifest.json missing; skipping ref sha256 check`.
//! 7. **Underpowered.** At `n_chunk=24` the bootstrap 95% CIs of five arms
//!    spanning 0.044–0.067 overlapped; only one pair separated.
//!
//! Accordingly: [`Estimator`] records how a reference was estimated,
//! [`WindowSpec`] makes the scored range explicit rather than implied,
//! [`OracleStats`] is stored in the header, [`ArtifactId`] carries a digest
//! for every input, and reduction reports intervals rather than point
//! estimates.
