# Narrow spec: Qwen3.5-VL vision serve bring-up (arch 5 carrier, HTTP stream contract)

Status: **branch-implemented on `feat/qwen35-vl` (2026-08-27)** — see the
as-built blockquote below; quality claims beyond the cited smokes remain
fail-closed until a `docs/VALIDATION.md` VL row exists. The VL route rows
landed 2026-08-27 (see the final blockquote); running a claim under its
route with fresh identity hashes is still required per [`VALIDATION.md`](../VALIDATION.md).
Author: engineering (hipfire agent)
Date: 2026-08-27
Parent family spec: [`qwen35-vl-mq4v2-spec.md`](../qwen35-vl-mq4v2-spec.md)
(§3 "Runtime — verify-only" plus §4 shared artifact contract; this record is
the scoped fix for the one part of §3 verification that FAILED live)
Sibling narrow spec:
[`docs/specs/2026-08-27-lfm2-vl-vision-runtime.md`](../../../) on
`feat/lfm2-vl` — the same two stream-contract fixes were landed there for the
arch-11 carrier; this branch ports them and nothing else from that branch.

## 0. Problem statement

The 2026-08-27 validation ledger
(`.codeinsight+research/vl-validation-2026-08-27/RESULTS.md`) recorded that
arch-5 VL bring-up passed locally (`run --image` OCR on the requantized
NuExtract3 artifact reads all fixtures correctly) while the HTTP image path
on `vl-serve-qwen35` (:6901) delivered **zero response bytes** — the daemon
ran tower + prefill + generation, but an OpenAI-client image turn saw an
empty stream, and repeated attempts could leave the single admission slot
held.

Root cause (finding b of the ledger, root-caused the same day on the sibling
branch): `generate_vl` and `generate_vl_dots_ocr` never emitted the
**`gen_start` stream-contract opener**. The HTTP layer's StreamContractGate
rejects every event that arrives without a preceding `gen_start` for the
request id, so all VL events after the opener-less stream began are dropped
before reaching the client socket. Text-path `generate()` has emitted the
opener since the e99583afa-class fixes; the VL entry points predate the gate
and were never retrofitted.

## 1. Goal and scope

1. `generate_vl` (the arch 5/6 qwen-VL arm reached via
   `VisionRoute::QwenVl`) emits `gen_start` as the FIRST event of its
   stream — before any GPU work, error path, or info event.
2. `generate_vl_dots_ocr` (arch 8 arm sharing the same HTTP surface)
   gets the identical opener.
3. Verify live over HTTP on :6901 that image turns stream visible bytes,
   and that client disconnect mid-image-turn releases the slot for the next
   request (ledger finding c re-check for THIS carrier).
4. Record binary md5s, artifact sha256, fixture hashes in the evidence
   ledger per §7 of the parent spec.

**Deliberately NOT ported from `feat/lfm2-vl`:**

- `VisionRoute::Lfm2Vl`, `LoadedModel::lfm2_vision()`,
  `has_vision_encoder()` — arch-11 loader/carrier API living on the sibling
  branch. The daemon `has_vl` gate here stays
  `m.vision_config().is_some() || m.dots_ocr().is_some()`, which already
  covers arch 5/6 (`vision_config` populated for `has_vision` artifacts —
  proven by the 2026-08-27 ledger container smokes on these binaries) and
  arch 8. Gate unification lands when the branches merge to master, not by
  cross-porting half an API.
- The lfm2-VL body (`generate_lfm2_vl`) and its abort-pair corrections —
  no arch-11 code belongs on this branch.
- `docs/VALIDATION.md` VL rows (§6 of parent spec): evidence from this
  bring-up justifies a future proposal; it does not write the rows.

## 2. Change specification

### 2.1 Opener placement invariant

The opener MUST be the first event written to the request stream. In both
functions it goes immediately after the CPU-sampler RNG reset (generate_vl)
or at function top (generate_vl_dots_ocr), before any early-return/error
path:

```rust
let gen_contract = crate::common::gen_start_contract_version_for_arch(m.arch_id);
emit_gen_start(stdout, params.id, false, gen_contract);
```

Contract-version selection goes through the shared helper — never a literal.
`params.id` (not the ambient attempt id) identifies the stream, matching the
text path.

### 2.2 Files touched

- `crates/hipfire-generate/src/vision.rs` — import `emit_gen_start`; insert
  one opener block per function (§2.1). No other change.
- Nothing else. No loader, daemon, engine, or carrier edits on this branch.

### 2.3 Abort-terminal audit (verification item, potential follow-up)

Finding (c) of the ledger concerned the *newly written* lfm2-VL body. On
this branch the existing abort polls already emit the canonical pair where
they exist (e.g. dots n-gram prefill: `emit_qwen_ar_cancelled`). Whether the
main generate_vl decode loop checks disconnects mid-generation at all was
NOT audited before the fix window. This spec makes it a live verification
item (§3 case D): disconnect mid-image-turn must free the slot within
generation-completion time. If it wedges permanently, the follow-up (abort
polls + canonical terminals inside the qwen-VL loops) gets its own scoped
commit and spec amendment — not folded silently into this one.

## 3. Verification plan (bring-up tier, gfx1101)

Route class: serving smoke of the hipfire-tester quick-start tier. Not a
VALIDATION.md claim route; no perf numbers.

| case | steps | pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| A build identity | `cargo build --release` (daemon AND cli); md5sum both | binaries differ from deployed :6901 snapshot; md5s recorded |
| B listing + text | swap container; `GET /v1/models`; text completion | model listed under filename-id; math prompt → correct greedy answer (append `/no_think` per ledger quirk) |
| C image turn streams | `/v1/chat/completions` with `image_url` data URI = committed fixture + OCR/desc prompts | streamed SSE chunks arrive incrementally (≥ several data events, not one empty terminal); decoded text matches the 2026-05-23 comparison readings incl. known-variance notes |
| D disconnect recovery | start image turn, kill client mid-stream, immediately issue text turn | text turn answers without restart; no permanent slot wedge |
| E local parity spot-check | `hipfire run --image` against same fixture | still coherent (opener added must not disturb the stdio contract consumers) |

Fail-closed notes: fixtures pinned by SHA-256; artifact remains
`~/AI/models/nuextract3/NuExtract3-mq4v2-vlval.mq4`
(sha256 `5bfea8b7…fe68c6` full hash re-recorded at swap time). Read every
decoded output by eye — the eyeball rule applies to image batteries even at
bring-up tier.

## 4. As-built

> daemon logs showed `[daemon-control] received abort` arriving while
> generation continued to completion with no recognized terminal ever
> emitted) — the finding-(c) class, reached through a different door than on
> arch 11. Scoped follow-up commit added two cancel polls to `generate_vl`
