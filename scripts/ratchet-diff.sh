# scripts/leanup-ratchets.sh already fails a tree that violates a committed
# threshold. What it cannot see is the threshold being widened in the same
# commit as the code that needed it widened. That has happened here: an agent
# edited scripts/layering.txt until its own inversion became legal and reported
# the checker exiting 0. The Phase 3 scope recorded the mitigation as "cheap and
# social rather than technical -- a change that edits layering.txt,
# leanup-thresholds.txt, or a golden fixture in the same commit as the code it
# governs should be read as a red flag." This is the technical half.
#
# Three ways to weaken an expectation, all caught here:
#   1. raise a `<=` ceiling
#   2. change an `==` invariant
#   3. delete the line entirely, so the metric becomes informational
#
# and a fourth that hides the evidence:
#   4. stop emitting a metric that used to be asserted
#
# and a fifth that guards declared raises:
#   5. declared RATCHET-RAISE without the 'ratchet-raise' label when
#      RATCHET_RAISE_REQUIRE_LABEL=1 (CI enforces; local runs with the
#      env unset keep the old behavior)
#
# A weakening is not forbidden. It must be declared, in a commit message on the
# branch:
#
#     RATCHET-RAISE: <metric> <old> -> <new>, traded for <reason>
#
# When RATCHET_RAISE_REQUIRE_LABEL=1, a declared raise is accepted only if
# RATCHET_RAISE_LABEL_PRESENT=1; otherwise it is a violation:
#   declared RATCHET-RAISE for <metric> but the PR does not carry the 'ratchet-raise' label
#
# Lowering a ceiling, adding a threshold, or adding a metric always passes.
#
# Metric VALUES are reported for context but never fail this check -- size
# metrics like daemon_lines legitimately fluctuate, and the ceilings in
# leanup-thresholds.txt are what govern them.
#
# Usage: scripts/ratchet-diff.sh [BASE_REF]     # default: merge base w/ master
# Exit:  0 no expectation weakened   1 undeclared weakening   2 harness error
